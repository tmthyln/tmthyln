### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm part-time working and getting my Master's in CS, with a focus on slightly more theoretical aspects of machine learning and more effective visualizations.

Here are some projects I'm working on:
- 

Here are some packages I've authored or contributed to (all in Julia):
- ZhuyinPinyin.jl - functions for converting between zhuyin and pinyin
- IDSGraphs.jl - tools for analyzing ideographs and their component relationships
- CEDICT.jl - programmatic access to the CC-CEDICT dictionary
- ARMANets.jl - implementation of ARMA-Nets layer (compatible with Flux)
- MinesweeperSolvers.jl - assorted solvers for the minesweeper game (and a simple, fast game implementation)
- ChineseCharacterFrequencies.jl - access to a bunch of different character frequencies for Chinese language texts
