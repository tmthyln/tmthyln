### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a machine learning researcher who makes packages that no one needs in my part-time.

Here are some of my Julia projects (some mostly completed, others still very much works-in-progress):
- Exploring the Chinese language
  - ZhuyinPinyin.jl - functions for converting between zhuyin and pinyin
  - IDSGraphs.jl - tools for analyzing ideographs and their component relationships
  - CEDICT.jl - programmatic access to the CC-CEDICT dictionary
  - CJKFrequencies.jl - access to a bunch of different character frequencies for Chinese language texts
- Miscellaneous games
  - MinesweeperSolvers.jl - assorted solvers for the minesweeper game (and a simple, fast game implementation)
  - MahjongTiles.jl - basics for working with Mahjong games (no actual game implementation)
- Machine learning-related
  - ARMANets.jl - implementation of ARMA-Nets layer (compatible with Flux)
